# StalkerAlert

Id, Ego, Superego-key — social security.
Dreams now require a password;
the unconscious logs in through a proxy.
Freud’s triptych collapses into a form field:
username: desire,
password: repression.

The analyst is replaced by a data center.
Validation tokens expire faster than guilt.
The Id hides in cached memories,
the Ego syncs to cloud storage,
the Superego audits your browser history.
Authentication failed.
Try again with your mother’s maiden name.

Selective amnesia? Deliberate.

NPD cries breach of trust — a personal history dissected,
as though the world were a lab and empathy a microscope.
They claim HIPAA applies to everyone,
as if every observer were a doctor.
Privacy becomes performance;
shame, a patent-pending diagnosis.

Differentially equate — logic and loss.
Between heaven and data,
between Freud and fire,
the world remembers selectively,
and forgets on purpose.
